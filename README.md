# REAL-TIME-OBJECT-TRACKING-USING-EUCLIDEAN-DISTANCE
"I developed a real-time object tracking system utilizing Euclidean distance calculations, CNNs for object detection, and OpenCV for video processing. Additionally, PyTesseract was integrated for optical character recognition, enabling dynamic and accurate tracking of objects in live video feeds."
